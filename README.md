# Blackjack

This simple command line game of Blackjack is written in Python, allowing players to engage in multiple rounds against a dealer.

## Game Overview

Blackjack is a card game where the goal is to get cards that add up to as close to 21 as possible, without exceeding this value. Each player is dealt two cards initially, with the option to "hit" for another card, or "stand" to stick with their current total. The dealer also receives two cards, hitting until their cards total 17 or more. Multiple rounds of the game can be played, as specified by the user at the start.
